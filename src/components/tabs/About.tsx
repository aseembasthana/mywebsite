          <p>
            Hello! I'm Aseem Asthana, a Senior Technical Lead at Cisco Systems in San Jose, CA.
            With over 20 years of experience, I specialize in architecting and developing
            cloud-based, multi-tenant, highly scalable web services, particularly in real-time
            collaboration and media applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I lead the architecture and implementation of Control Hub AI, designing
            AI/ML solutions including Generative AI capabilities and the EMPATH real-time sentiment
            analysis system. I've secured 25 patents, authored four publications, and contributed
            significantly to revenue generation and customer acquisition at Cisco.
          </p>
          <p>Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:</p>
          <ul className="skills-list">
            {technologies.map((tech, index) => (

          </ul>
